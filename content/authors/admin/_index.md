      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a motivated Researcher/Developer with exposure in AI/ML, medical image processing, and Flutter app development. Finished my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and am currently engaged in medical imaging-based research in the Department of CSE at Independent University, Bangladesh. Working in Medical AI towards predicting abnormality, disease detection, monitoring disease progression, and prevention of misdiagnosis. My focus lies in developing automatic methods for region of interest (ROI) localization from radiologic images using modern deep learning techniques.
Research Interests: Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), Computer-aided Detection (CADe), Medical image processing, Deep Learning.

The vision is to work on novel approaches that will - 
i) Offer comprehensive diagnosis solutions
ii) Develop assistive systems that will contribute as decision support system in clinical workflows of disease diagnosis.
iii) Aiming towards interdisciplinary collaborative approach with researchers, clinicians and industry experts.
iv) Explainable AI (XAI) in biomedical; improving patient communication, ensuring model reliability and regulatory standards.
