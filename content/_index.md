      text: |-
        Motivated Researcher/Developer working in AI/ML, medical image processing, and Flutter app development. Finished my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science and currently engaged in medical imaging-based research under Dr. Saadia Binte in the Medical Imaging Research & Analysis (MIRA) Wing, CCDS. 
        Working in Medical AI towards predicting abnormality, disease detection, monitoring disease progression, and prevention of misdiagnosis. My focus lies in developing automatic methods for region of interest (ROI) localization from radiologic images using modern deep learning techniques.
        
        Research Interests: Medical Image Processing, Computer-aided Detection (CADe), Computer-aided Diagnosis (CADx), Deep Learning, Biomedical Engineering, and Renewable Energy.

        The vision is to work on novel approaches that will - 
          i) Offer comprehensive diagnosis solutions
          ii) Develop assistive systems that will contribute as decision support system in clinical workflows of disease diagnosis.
          iii) Aiming towards interdisciplinary collaborative approach with researchers, clinicians and industry experts.
          iv) Explainable AI (XAI) in biomedical; improving patient communication, ensuring model reliability and regulatory standards.
